<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">
    “When everyone throws the book at the person who fired you, but who knows, the agencies might be equally responsible for that. Just no one noticed,” a one-time domestic helper said. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">
    Tracy (not her real name), a 33-year-old Filipino single mother first came to Hong Kong about two months ago, with promises of better work which would enable her to financially support her family. Around one week after arrival, her contract was suddenly terminated because of the “unclear medical record”.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">
    She was employed for seven days and then got fired for having the non-infectious disease after paying the local agency called Best Choice Employment Centre thousands of dollars. However, before leaving the Philippines, the medical result she has got there stated that she was “fit to work.”</p> 
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">
    The helper also went to one of the Hong Kong medical centres to check physical health status. She said, “the examination does not state anywhere that I am unfit to work.” </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">The local agency asked her to write a letter to her employer and explained the incident in details but mostly under their instructions and they wrote a big part of it, she said. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;"> Her medical examination in the Philippines was taken away by them and she herself was still sacked without giving one month notice or wage. “The agency just informed me that the employer did not want to employ me anymore, apparently because of my medical condition,” she continued. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;"> She questioned, “I’m unhappy with the employer’s decision but what did the agency do? Did they offer help? No, they [agencies in both the Philippines and Hong Kong] just claimed that in order to find a new employer, I need to go back to the Philippines, not to mention pay additional service fees.” </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">Tracy returned to her hometown last Saturday. When being asked if she would come again, she paused for a few seconds and answered, “probably not.” </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">She was one of the many domestic helpers who aspire to work outside of their home countries in search of better work opportunities but instead are grossly cheated, disrespected and exploited by employers and even agencies. </p>
    <br> 
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">“The agency enticed me to apply for jobs in the UK with generous benefits so I paid them the full amount of HK$10,000 for the processing fee. But when I got there two months later, the office was closed and the contact person in the UK could not even be reached,” said Lisa (not her real name), who has come to Hong Kong since 2014. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">Esther Buhay Bangcawayan, the case officer of Mission for Migrant Workers(MFMW), said Tracy was not the only one who faced discrimination and got lack assistance from the employers and agencies. She said both Tracy and Lisa paying the agencies hefty fees without getting any official receipts were misled by intermediary agencies to some extent. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">She suggested that the local government should take stronger actions against irresponsible employers and employment agencies such as imposing the higher penalty on those who violate the basic rights of workers. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">Tracy and Lisa are the helpers who seek assistance from Mission for Migrant Workers((MFMW). </p>

        <p> HelperChoice, the local online platform that connects domestic helpers and employers directly
        conducted a survey among about 200 domestic workers and found that 85% of first-time 
        domestic helpers are charged illegal placement fees by the recruitment agencies which should be only 
        allowed to charge job seekers maximum 10% of their first-month salart as placement fees.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>Despite those illegal practices, only a third of the domestic helpers ever 
            planned to sue the agency that overcharged them. See the pie chart below: </p>

<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;"> Another study by Students Against Fees and Exploitation (SAFE) at the University of Hong Kong found that more than 70% of domestic helper recruitment agencies in Hong Kong broke the law by overcharging fees or withholding passports. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;"> Hans Ladegaard, a head of Department of English at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who conducted an array of studies into domestic migrant workers’ abuse stories for his recent book The Discourse of Powerlessness and Repression, explained that only a handful of agencies would take the responsibility seriously to look after the needs between workers and employers. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">“Most agencies are happy to take migrant domestic workers’ hard-earned money, but are not committed to helping them when they need it,” he continued. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">Kirs Larsson, the founder of Fair Choice Domestic Helper Service said that she started the agency company because she was angry at what foreign domestic helpers have been suffered for years.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">The founder thought both agencies and employers played an important role in helping the workers adapt to an unfamiliar environment. “After reading pieces about the debt bondage and abused domestic helpers in Hong Kong, we hope we can, in some small parts, make a difference,” she added. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">The employment organisation for Filipino domestic helpers, which aims to offer a fair and ethical service to employers and helpers with comprehensive follow-up service and post-employment support, screens the candidates before matching the right helper with the right family in order to create a long and prosperous relationship among them. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;">“So far approximately 80% of our pair-ups has been a success with both happy employers and helpers, and 20% with some complaints from the helpers, mainly about heavy workload or long working hours,” she indicated. </p>
<br>
Earlier this year, the Hong Kong government led by former Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying announced its plans to strengthen the regulation of employment agencies, which may better protect the labour rights of the city’s migrant domestic workers. </p>
